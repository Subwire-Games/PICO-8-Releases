# PICO-8-Releases
The source code for our PICO-8 releases on itch.io and the Lexaloffle BBS. Source is uploaded when the next game is released.

Please be warned that code for a lot of these games will be a little sloppy in places, as each game is developed over the course of a single month, or in some cases, less time. However, we hope the source for each of these games will help other PICO-8 developers implement techniques we have used in our games for the PICO-8. We do not provide the assets that were created for the game however, and each game is essentially copied over into a folder, with each of the PICO-8's code tabs exported into single .lua files.
